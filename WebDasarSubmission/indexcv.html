          <p>People and oily things always have a love-hate relationship. Everyone enjoys eating fries, junk food, and fatty beef. Otherwise, many of us despise seeing the fat in our thighs or the pile of fat that protrudes from our stomachs. So, which one are you?</p>
          <p>It appears that a large portion of the population still enjoys fries, as evidenced by the world's high consumption and production of palm oil, particularly in Indonesia.In sixty years, from 1961 to 2021, the global production of palm oil has gotten 52 times higher. As well as the higher production, the consumption rate in Indonesia also increased by 2.11 times in ten years. The majority of Indonesians (68%) use it for food; only a few producers (5%) use it for bioenergy, and the rest use it for industrial purposes other than food.</p>

          <p>Before going further, according to katadata.co.id, there are only 35.7% of cooking oil users who utilize UCOs. It is totally bad that most of us are UCOs waster! It is hazardous because it will clog drains, emit a rancid odor, pollute soil and water, cause us to see an unstable aquatic system, block sunlight from reaching the water, and so on.</p>
